/**
 * @fileoverview This class offers a component architecture for projects that include highly interactive user
 * interfaces. Unlike tart.Component which features a classical MVC role seperation - with 5 or 6 classes, which is
 * also a heavy implementation - tart.ui.Component uses 3 classes and joins the roles of the Template, View and
 * Controller into one Component class.
 *
 * The other roles help responsibility seperation that is necessary enough for a UI component.
 *
 * The Component class is useful for event management; it listens to DOM events, map these to related functions in the
 * model and vice versa.
 *
 * The model is responsible for all the states of the component and the business logic.
 * The component shouldn't keep state and should be as dummy as possible; any state change on the model is dispatched
 * via an event to the Component class to update itself. This decoupled architecture makes it possible that business
 * critical unit tests of the component can run fully functionally without a DOM. The model may also be responsible for
 * dealing with the data in any way (remote requests, other events to other modules in the system, etc).
 *
 * Finally, the third, optional class is a value class, which is like a POJO. It keeps all the related data in an
 * instance. This allows one to exchange data in the application with very lightweight data objects - make it through a
 * constructor class and you get to keep object oriented design.
 *
 * So, the data the component displays or deals with resides in a value class. The model keeps its state and business
 * logic, and the Component class makes the representation.
